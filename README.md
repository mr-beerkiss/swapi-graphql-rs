# Star Wars GraphQL API in Rust

A very, very bad graphql implementation of the Star Wars API in Rust. I know it's bad, but it's how
I've decided to teach myself Rust.

I won't accept PRs but if you would like to suggest improvements, or help me improve my understanding of rust, please raise an issue.

Based on [juniper](https://github.com/graphql-rust/juniper) and [actix](https://github.com/actix/actix-web). Data copied from the [Star Wars API](https://swapi.dev).
